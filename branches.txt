creating a branch on a local repository doesn't get reflected on the master with git desktop (GD) sync - obvious really.

commiting the change on a branch in GD.
Pay attention to the 'Commit to creating-a-new-branch' in GD...
easy, to be on the wrong branch (top of the screen),
 even though the railway tracks look ok.
(On master you get the Sync option in GD, on the branch the Publish button appears)
And yes, you can still change branches in GD while editing a file...and the disk changes.
commit in GD.
Publish (GD)
Create pull request (GD)
Take care that in GD the active dot is to the far right...it doesn't always move when a file is updated elsewhere on the computer.
approve the pull request on githubweb (GW).
can merge without problems, and offered to delete branch.
GD doesn't know about loss of branch....so switch back to master (GD) and sync.
