creating a branch on a local repository doesn't get reflected on the master with git desktop (GD) sync - obvious really.

commiting the change on a branch in GD.
Pay attention to the 'Commit to creating-a-new-branch' in GD...
easy, to be on the wrong branch (top of the screen),
 even though the railway tracks look ok.
(On master you get the Sync option in GD, on the branch the Publish button appears)
And yes, you can still change branches in GD while editing a file...and the disk changes.
